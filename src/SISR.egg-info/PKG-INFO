Summary: A stoichiometrically-informed method to fit the rate constants in a reaction mechanism through differential optimization and couple that fitting method with a genetic optimization approach that searches a symbolic space of possible reaction mechanisms to find the mechanism that best matches a time-series dataset of concentrations. It returns a symbolic chemical reaction mechanism, the rate constant for each reaction in the mechanism, and the kinetic equations that describe the chemical process under examination.

## Description
A stoichiometrically-informed method to fit the rate constants in a reaction mechanism through differential optimization and couple that fitting method with a genetic optimization approach that searches a symbolic space of possible reaction mechanisms to find the mechanism that best matches a time-series dataset of concentrations.
It returns a symbolic chemical reaction mechanism, the rate constant for each reaction in the mechanism, and the kinetic equations that describe the chemical process under examination.
